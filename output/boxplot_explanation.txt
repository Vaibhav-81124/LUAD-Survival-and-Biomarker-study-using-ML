Box Plot for Gene Expression by Survival Status
-----------------------------------------------

Box plots help visualize how gene expression varies between patients who survived vs. those who didn't.

- Useful for identifying potential biomarkers.
- Highlights outliers and expression spread.
- Median line shows central tendency.
- Helps biological interpretation.

This can guide future survival analysis or functional validation.
